   routine (and change name to convert_to_32).
 
 Oct 31, 2008      IRRd 2.3.5   Release notes
   Added !6 command for route6 inverse query on origin AS.
   Added KEY_F flags for person, role, and nic-hdl attributes
   so that they are returned with -K flag.

 Dec 16, 2004	   IRRd 2.2.3	Release notes

     Call setsockopt to clear IPV6_V6ONLY flag (if defined) so
that sockets will accept both IPV4 and IPV6 connections.  Primarily
affects the BSD's as they do not accept IPV4 mapped connections on
an IPV6 socket by default.

 Nov 22, 2004	   IRRd 2.2.2	Release notes

     Fixed a bug in handling of irr_expansion_timeout so that a value
of zero is correctly treated as no timeout.  Use a merge-sort on
expansion output for much greater efficiency (note this largely obviates the
need for irr_expansion_timeout, but we leave it in just in case.)

 Nov 18, 2004	   IRRd 2.2.1	Release notes

     Allow PeerAS in asno RP-attribute.  add irr_expansion_timeout to allow
interruption of long set expansions.  add support for RIPE -x flag and

IRRToolSet to use -protocol ripe with IRRd.

     Intitial 2.2 release.   First formal release to support RPSLng
 and IPv6.  Enjoy.

 Jul 15, 2004 
		   IRRd 2.2b34  Release notes

    irr_database_clean() could corrupt a db file if an object is
 followed with a "#"-prefixed comment line.  It is unclear from RFC2622
 whether or not a line beginning with a "#" comment character is legal.
 We now allow such lines rather than removing them.

 Jul 14, 2004 
		   IRRd 2.2b33  Release notes

    Cleaned up some logging output to be more consistent (don't prefix
 log strings with "IRR" as they are automatically prefixed with "IRRD").
 Fix irrd_log_report.pl script to handle new log output and IPv6.

 Jun 06, 2004 
		   IRRd 2.2b32  Release notes

    Send new maintainers request with a From: address of the
 sender rather than the db-admin (fixed to improve spam filters).

 May 12, 2004
		   IRRd 2.2b31  Release notes

    Bring into compliance with latest rpslng draft (draft -05).
  Fix bug with !g expansions when route6 objects are present
  with the given origin AS.

 April 22, 2004

		   IRRd 2.2b30  Release notes

    Fixed unitialized buffer bug.

 December 16, 2003

                   IRRd 2.2b28  Release notes


    This beta 2.2 release incorporates support for RPSLng.  Other
  features include support for CRYPT-PW hiding and a flag for
  irr_rpsl_submit to allow inetnum/inet6num/as-block/domain
  objects.  Full indexing for inetnum (Radix) and as-block (hash)
  objects is not yet complete.  The Changelog has not been
  updated yet.


 October 17, 2002
		   IRRd 2.1.5  Release notes

    Support has been added for performing inverse searches on the
  mnt-by: attribute in objects.  This is accomplished with the '!o'
  command or '-i mnt-by' query flag.
    route-set expansion with '!i' command now correctly handles aut-num
  and as-set's within a route-set.  Expansion of route-set's with
  multiple level's of range expressions now works correctly.
    Fixed handling of 'debug submission' command in config file which
  caused irr_rpsl_submit to segfault.
    Fixed support for response_notify_header and response_forward_header
  in config file (used by irr_rpsl_submit).
    Create a new CURRENTSERIAL file for a registry db if one does not
  already exist and prevent corruption of IRRD_STATUS file.
    Improved performance when making mass bulk updates and when performing
  set expansions.
    Update serial number when mirroring a remote registry db even
  when object class is unrecognized (to address syncronization issues
  with db's which use non-RPSL standard object classes).
    Several potential buffer overflows addressed that affected
  irr_rpsl_submit.
    Replace use of mktemp with mkstemp in a number of modules to
  address gcc's complaints about mktemp being unsafe.
    Documentation updates to User Manual.

 Feb  4, 2002
		   IRRd 2.1.4  Release notes

    The code that handled mirror requests was locking the mirrored database
  for the entire duration of a mirror update transfer (in some cases, this
  was observed to take up to 2 minutes).  Mirror transfers are now buffered
  in memory to avoid keeping a lock on a database.
    The database cleaning and export code would lock the database for
  the entire clean/export operation.  A new "clean_lock" has been added to
  allow queries (but not updates) during a cleaning or export operation.
    The path to install-sh was not being set properly by configure.
    Berkeley DB and GDBM support have been removed (this code had not been
  maintained and it's operational state was unknown).
    Route searches with the 'M' more specific flag now allow searches on
  /16 prefixes or longer.
    The 'routing-registry-objects' filter has been updated to allow inet-rtr
  objects.
    A config file syntax error when performing config saves has been fixed.
    Some minor user manual updates for the !u command. 

 Oct 18, 2001
		   IRRd 2.1.3  Release notes

  The 2.1.3 release fixes a compile problem on Solaris 8 with irr_check.
  The release also now successfully compiles on systems without pgp/gpg
  installed.  The default location for binaries is now the sbin directory.
  A 3 second timeout for sending data on UII telnet connections was
  too short in some cases, change to 30 seconds.

 Sep 24, 2001
		   IRRd 2.1.2  Release notes

  The 2.1.2 release fixes a bug in irr_rpsl_submit which resulted in the
  process exiting prematurely on Linux (due to a redundant fclose() call).
  There was also a bug in the configure script which resulted in PGP not
  being correctly enabled on systems with PGP/GnuPG binaries.  Manual updates
  have also been made to correct an erroneous documentation concerning
  invoking irr_rpsl_submit via email submissions and the use of the "-D" flag.
  Also note that irr_rpsl_submit must be able to update the PGP directory and
  ring files in order to support PGP authentication.

 Sep 18, 2001
		   IRRd 2.1.1  Release notes

  The 2.1.1 release fixes a possible race condition in the UII code
  with short-lived UII telnet connections.  Also, an updated PDF manual,
  ChangeLog, and NOTES file are now included in the distribution.
